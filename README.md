# 8051-DEVELOPEMENT-BOARD-89E51RD2-
8051 DEVELOPEMENT BOARD WITH (89E51RD2)
## INTRODUCTION
Logsun’s DEVELOPMENT board has 8-bit 89E51RD2. A Microcontroller based evaluation 
module. DEVELOPMENT is a general-purpose development board for RD2
microcontroller. PR51-V4can is used extensively to test and validate Programs. At the 
heart of the development board is 89E51RD2P; this provides advance features like ISP, 
I2C and IAP. The microcontroller has 64KB internal flash memory and 1KB on-chip RAM. 
The development board comes with RS-232 interface to allow user to program the 
microcontroller directly from PC.
